Translation Web Service Test Protocol

Implement a REST service that will serve translated strings.

- Clients should be able to add new translations with a key (String) and a language id (also String).

- Clients should be able to query with a key (String) and a language id (also String).
- The Server should return the translation string associated with that key.


Example:
Client adds for language code ‘en’, buy-chips = “Buy chips”
/api/v1.0/translation
POST
{
    language_id:"en",
    key:"buy-chips",
    translation:"Buy chips"
}

/api/v1.0/translation/en/buy-chips
GET
Clients can then query buy-chips for language ‘en’ and retrieve “Buy chips”
API:s, protocols, persistence store etc. are all to be chosen freely. There does not need to be any
graphical UI or admin capabilities. No client implementation is needed. We will use a HTTP client to
exercise the API.
Deliverable is the complete project that compiles and some simple instructions on how to access the
service.
